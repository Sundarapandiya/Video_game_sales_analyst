#Vide game sales analyst
This repository contains an analytical project exploring global video game sales data across different regions, platforms, genres, and publishers. The goal of this project is to uncover trends in the gaming industry — such as top-performing genres, sales by region, and the impact of release year and platform on game success.
The dataset is analyzed using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to provide actionable insights for game publishers, marketers, and analysts.
